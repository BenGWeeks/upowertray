Description: Lightweight battery tray indicator for Linux desktops (X11/Wayland)
 A Qt6-based battery status icon for laptop system trays. Works on KDE Plasma,
 LXQt, XFCE, Cinnamon, and MATE (both X11 and Wayland where supported) without
 interfering with systemd power management or power-profiles-daemon.
 Alternative to PowerDevil, xfce4-power-manager, or mate-power-manager for
 users who want systemd-logind to handle lid-close, suspend, and hibernate.
 Useful when your battery icon is missing after disabling other power managers.
 .
 Features:
  - Battery percentage with color-coded icon
  - Charging indicator (lightning bolt overlay)
  - Low battery notifications and warnings
  - Settings dialog with power profile control
  - Configurable notification thresholds
  - Multi-language support (English, Spanish)
